## Stellar Anchors

List: https://www.stellar.org/about/directory#anchors

### Tempo (FIAT RAMP)

Status: Website up, seems to be legit
Website: https://ico.tempo.eu.com/buy-xlm-online-or-in-person-paris

Services offered - buy xlm / btc / eth using EUR. There are some fees associated (they don't explicitly mark this as fees,
but they make money off the exchange rate itself), but they appear to be way cheaper than PayPal for transacting across
borders. Only fiat on ramp and no stablecoin services.

### Coins.ph

Status: Philippines focused, I don't think we should focus much on single country anchors since that would be too restrictive
an option. Could partner with them if they give us money though.

### Stronghold (STABLECOIN)

Website: https://stronghold.co
Status: As detailed in [anchors.md](anchors.md), Stronghold is the best proposed stablecoin on Stellar. "Proposed" because it doesn't have
a working platform yet. See [anchors.md](anchors.md) for review.

### Transfer To

Website: https://www.transfer-to.com/moneytransfer/tech#4
Status: No mention of stellar anywhere on their website

### NaoBTC (BTC ANCHOR)

Website: https://www.naobtc.com
Status: Single Page Website, seems shady

Looks to be a Chinese website. Has no description of guarantee or guarantors, but has functionality required for exchanging
btc and some history of people who have traded at https://steexp.com/account/GATEMHCCKCY67ZUCKTROYN24ZYT5GK4EQZ65JJLDHKHRUZI3EUEKMTCH

### RippleFox

Website: https://ripplefox.com/anchor/
Status: Website up, shady

Ripplefox is a RMB based stablecoin and was covered in [anchors.md](anchors.md). Please refer [anchors.md](anchors.md) for full review.

### Cellulant

Website: https://www.cellulant.com
Status: No mention of Stellar

### Clic (STABLECOIN)

Website: https://clic.world
Status: Website up, no demo interface

Clic has a stablecoin and apparnetly provides other services. But it doesn't offer a demo right away, so there is no
opportunity to test their claim or have a look at their interface

### Flutterwave

Website: https://flutterwave.com/
Status: Legit, no demo interface

Uber uses flutterwave to process local payments, YCombinator startup. No opportunity to test it out, but have a feeling this
is legit.

### Bloom

Philippines only

### SendX

Singapore only

### KlickEx

Website: https://www.klickex.co/news/2017/10/16/ibm-announces-major-blockchain-solution-with-klickex
Status: Stellar is only a partner, they use HyperLedger

All others following klickex in the [list](https://www.stellar.org/about/directory#anchors) are region restricted (non USD) but found a couple noteworthy ones:
